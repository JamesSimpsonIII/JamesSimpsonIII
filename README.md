### Hello, World! 👋🏾

I'm James, SysAdmin @CyberSaint Security and a current Junior studying Cloud Computing @WGU. I have a passion for Cloud Engineering, IaC, and all things Halloween 🎃. 
I am on a mission to combine those interests in order to build interesting and complex cloud projects that stand out among the rest. In doing so, I hope to inspire other
aspiring Cloud Engineers to follow their dreams of working in the Cloud and gain as much knowledge as possible along the way!
